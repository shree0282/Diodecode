				<b>Closed-circuit television (CCTV) is the use of video cameras to transmit a signal to a specific place, on a limited set of monitors.</b>
				<br>
				<br>
				Closed-circuit television camera systems (more widely known as CCTV camera systems) are universally used to transmit the signals of a video surveillance camera trained on a particular area to monitoring systems in another area. There are many advantages of having CCTV cameras in your home, business or in public areas such as traffic intersections, major highways, train stations and airports. Here are the top five advantages of CCTV cameras.

			<p class="inner-para">
				When you own your business, whether you know it or now it becomes your responsibility to look after your staff as well as your customers. With CCTV cameras you can help protect both employees and clients/customers in a number ways. The primary way is protecting them physically. If they are attacked inside of your establishment you can turn over video of the attack to the authorities to help them find the assailant. CCTV can also stop crime from happening in the first place (see below) and can clear up any misunderstandings if money or merchandise goes missing.

			<h3 class="lato-serif" style="text-align: left;">Protect Your Company from Lawsuits :</h3>
			<p class="inner-para">
				On the flip side, CCTV cameras can also help you protect your company from customers. Weâ€™ve all heard the stories of customers purposely putting glass or pests in their food in order to get a free meal, or purposely spilling water and slipping in it in order to sue a company. With a CCTV camera video surveillance system you can monitor any fraudulence going on, and prevent you or your employees from being accused of false accusations or phony lawsuits.
